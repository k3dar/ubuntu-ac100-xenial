# Porting Ubuntu 16.04 to Toshiba AC100

> :exclamation: **Important:** My AC100 is dead and I cannot support this project anymore. As you may have noticed, issues tab was disabled and probably there will be no updates anymore. Sorry for inconvenience and thanks for your help and suggestions.

![Overview](https://github.com/nthchild/ubuntu-ac100-xenial/raw/master/screen.png)

This is **experimental**, slipstreamed Xubuntu desktop. Many things don't work yet. I'm not responsible for any stability and functionality issues.

It is **strongly recommended** to use virtual machine/secondary operating system to build root filesystem.

## Changes I've applied

Compared to my Ubuntu 14.04 port

- All upstream patches and changes
- U-boot and upstream Linux 3.16 kernel
- XFCE instead of GNOME Flashback

Many things are not ported yet, such as keybinding, swap partition or themes.

## Known issues

- No proprietary graphics drivers - therefore no HDMI output, HW acceleration, or webcam support
- No sound yet
- Cannot turn off device (please shutdown system, then hold power button)
- Random kernel panics

## How to build

1. Make sure you're running Ubuntu 16.04
2. Install `debootstrap` and `qemu-user-static` packages
3. Download this repository to your PC
4. As root, execute `./build.sh`

Tip: You can use `time` utility to display how much time the process took (less than 1 hour in most cases), or append `2>&1 | tee log.txt` to save logs. Output file is called `rootfs.tgz`.

## Prepare device

1. Install proprietary nvflash utility (can be found [here](https://github.com/nthchild/ubuntu-ac100/blob/master/nvflash_20110628-2_all.deb)).
2. Connect AC100 to PC, press and hold Ctrl+Esc+Power.
3. Execute `nvflash --bl sos-uboot-r5-2013-09-23.bin --go` to boot into recovery mode

## Install Ubuntu

1. Copy two files to FAT32-formatted flash memory
   - `installer.sh`
   - `rootfs.tar.xz`
2. If you don't have U-boot installed, run `./switch-to-uboot` 
3. Mount USB device: `mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 /mnt`
4. Start installer and follow instructions: `sh /mnt/installer.sh`
5. Reboot device, wait 1-2 minutes to see setup wizard and finish installation.
